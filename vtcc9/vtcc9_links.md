*COMMENTARY:*

<br/>

* * *

### - Coherence

[Coherence Etymology](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=coherent)


<br/>

*COMMENTARY: The root of the word is from the Latin for "to stick together". When you are going "to cohere", the objects begin separated and __move closer__ to become "one". I would like to highlight the gap between computational problem solution and programming language design, especially from a historical perspective. Despite significant inertia over the decades, the long-term trend is to close this gap.*

<br/>

* * *

### - Shorten the conceptual gap

>... our intellectual powers are rather geared to master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we should [...] shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.

[Go To Statement Considered Harmful](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/1901807/mod_resource/content/1/p147-salton.pdf)

<br/>

*COMMENTARY: Djikstra's famous letter provides our first example of a coherence problem, where the static text and the dynamic execution are conceptually separated, making understanding and reasoning about the program more difficult."*

*June 21, 1948 - Program runs successfully on first binary, digital, electronic stored-program computer (in which data and instructions are stored in same memory)*

*Highest proper factor; uses subtraction instead of division*

<br/>

### - Highest proper factor (attempt #1)



```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val input = 12
	var remainder = input
	var factor = input - 1

	while (factor > 1) {
	while (remainder >= 0) {
		if (remainder == 0) {
		println(factor)
		return
		}
		remainder = remainder - factor
	}
	remainder = input
	factor--
	}
}
```

- No annotations of type; they are "inferred"
- *val* is unchangeable
- *var* is destructive assignment; value is destroyed elsewhere
- 'remainder' is not remainder at first; Englishy naming not that helpful
- Nested *println* modifies state in the environment, not in the program/algorithm
- Nested return is a jump (ie GO TO)
- Statement nesting leads to *conceptual gap* that has to be jumped over


<br/>

### But is it correct?

<br/>

* * *

### - Accepted methodology ... find more bugs and make more patches

>The accepted methodology for program construction was [...]: People would write code and make test runs, then find bugs and make patches, then find more bugs and make more patches, and so on until not being able to discover any further errors, yet always living in dread for fear that a new case would turn up on the next day and lead to a new type of failure

### - Coding is not a static process of translation

>Thus the relation of the coded instruction sequence to the mathematically conceived procedure of (numerical) solution is not a statical one, that of a translation, but highly dynamical ... (p.2)

>Our problem is then to find simple, step-by-step methods, by which these difficulties can be overcome. Since coding is not a static process of translation, but rather the technique of providing a dynamic background to control the automatic evolution of a meaning, it has to be viewed as a logical problem and one that represents a new branch of formal logics. (p.2)

>We now proceed to analyze the procedings by which one can build up the appropriate coded sequence for a given problem — or rather for a given numerical method to solve that problem. As was pointed out in 7.1, this is not a mere question of translation (of a mathematical text into a code), but rather a question of providing a control scheme for a highly dynamical process, all parts of which may undergo repeated and relevant changes in the course of this process. (p.4)

>We therefore propose to begin the planning of a coded sequence by laying out a schematic of the course of C through that sequence, i.e. through the required region of the selectron memory. This schematic is the __flow diagram__ of C (p.4)

### - Assigning Meanings to Programs

>The basis of our approach is ... an association of a proposition with each connection in the flow of control through a program.

### - Highest proper factor (as pseudo-assembly)

```
	   n ∉ ℙ  (where ℙ is the set of prime numbers)
	1. r ⟵ n
	2. f ⟵ r - 1
INNER:  3. if (r = 0?) goto EXIT
OUTER:  4. if (f = 1?) goto NEXT
	5. r ⟵ r - f
	6. goto INNER
NEXT:   7. f ⟵ f - 1
	8. r ⟵ n
	9. goto OUTER
EXIT:  10.
```

- Pseudo-assembly inspired by Hing Leung "Program Correctness" project http://bit.ly/2xrshIW
- Goal makes sense only for particular input set (non-Prime numbers)
- Termination condition moved to the outside
- Structured loops (ie *while*) become conditional jumps
- Loops are book-ended by two gotos
- Loop check is inverted from original structured version


<br/>

* * *

### - Highest proper factor (as flow chart)

![Flow Chart](https://github.com/ericssmith/presentations/blob/master/vtcc9/flowchart.png)


- TODO add assertions
- The starting and ending assertions are *assumed* to be true. The "program proof" is the assertion sequence in between.
- Proof of termination is separate from "partial completeness" proof
-
- Chart done in draw.io

<br/>

* * *

### - Highest proper factor (attempt #2)

```
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
	val input = 12
	var remainder = input
	var factor = input - 1

	loop@
	while (factor > 1) {
	while (remainder > 0) {
		remainder = remainder - factor
	}
	if (remainder == 0) break@loop
	factor--
	remainder = input
	}

	println(factor)
}
```

- Jump on terminating condition
- Output moved to boundary with environment
- Domain is incorrect; results in '1' for prime numbers

<br/>

* * *

### - Axiomatic Basis

>Computer programming is an exact science in that all the properties of a program and all the consequences of executing it in any given environment can, in principle, be found out from the text of the program itself by means of purely deductive reasoning.

### - An entirely different kind of power ... the ability to do recursions

>An entirely different kind of power arises from the flexibility of the hierarchy -- the ability to do recursions.
